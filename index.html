            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>1960: A legend is born in Sendai, Miyagi. Leading a modest life, but always living with a passion for writing and drawing manga.</li>
                    <li>1980:
                        After many trials and tribulations and even dropping out of the Miyagi University of Education he finally had his first manga published, Poker Under Arms.</li>
                    <li>1983: Another milestone hit, his first serialization in the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekly_Shōnen_Jump" target="_blank">"Weekly Shounen Jump"</a> with Cool Shock B.T. A short story omnibus about a sherlock holmes inspired miscreant.</li>

                    <li>1989: The iconic JoJo's Bizzare Adventure Part 3: Stardust Crusaders began its serialization. Many consider this set of volumes to be where the series actually took off.
